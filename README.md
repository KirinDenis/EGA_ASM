### My MS DOS 6.22 Assembler 8086 (TASM) works.

I did these projects in 1998-1999 years - while I was learning the assembler programming language. 

In those years, I was a student from a poor family. For this reason, I use old 80286 PC/AT with an EGA graphics card. 
So, the presented projects are made in 16 colors. A very interesting and unforgettable experience :)

Let this repository be my little personal museum üê≤
